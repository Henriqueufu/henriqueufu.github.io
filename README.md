The CRM case is a study aimed at understanding customer behaviors of a company that sells food online. The main points developed were:

- Detailed data exploration to understand the behavior of the customer base
- Creation of clusters to segment customers and enable customized actions for each group
- A predictive model designed to calculate the probability of a customer making a purchase given a marketing campaign

The web scraping technique is a powerful tool for obtaining data that is not easily available. It is important to always use this technique ethically, only consuming data for which the owners permit extraction.

OCR is another technique for obtaining data from challenging sources, in this case, images. OCR allows, for example, transforming a PDF into an image and then extracting the text from the image, which can be used as data.
